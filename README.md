    <h1>Week 1 Projects for CS50</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the Week 1 projects repository for CS50! In this repository, you'll find Python scripts that showcase various programming concepts covered during Week 1 of the CS50 course.</p>

    <h2>Project 1: Greetings Analysis</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Description:</strong> This script analyzes user greetings and assigns a monetary value based on specific conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Users are prompted to enter a greeting. The script then checks if the greeting starts with 'H' but does not contain 'Hello'. If so, it prints "$20". If the greeting contains 'Hello', it prints "$0". Otherwise, it prints "$100".</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Project 2: The Great Question</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Description:</strong> This script prompts users to answer the Great Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. It then verifies whether the provided answer is correct.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Users are asked to input their answer to the Great Question. If the answer is "forty two", "forty-two", or "42", the script responds with "Yes". Otherwise, it responds with "No".</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Project 3: File Type Identifier</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Description:</strong> This script helps users identify the file type based on the provided file name and its extension.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Users input a file name, and the script determines the corresponding file type based on its extension. Supported file types include images (gif, jpeg, png), PDFs, text files, and zip archives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Project 4: Arithmetic Expression Evaluator</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Description:</strong> This script evaluates arithmetic expressions provided by users and prints the result.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Users input arithmetic expressions in the format: "number1 operator number2". The script then evaluates the expression and prints the result. Supported operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Project 5: Meal Time Calculator</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Description:</strong> This script calculates meal times based on the current time input by the user.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Users input the current time, and the script determines whether it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner time. The script handles both 12-hour and 24-hour time formats.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each project serves as a hands-on exercise to reinforce programming fundamentals and problem-solving skills introduced during Week 1 of CS50.</p>
