# Week 1 Projects for CS50
<br>
Welcome to the Week 1 projects repository for CS50! In this repository, you'll find Python scripts that showcase various programming concepts covered during Week 1 of the CS50 course.
<br>
<br>
 Project 1: Greetings Analysis 
<br>
Description: This script analyzes user greetings and assigns a monetary value based on specific conditions.
<br>
Usage: Users are prompted to enter a greeting. The script then checks if the greeting starts with 'H' but does not contain 'Hello'. If so, it prints "$20". If the greeting contains 'Hello', it prints "$0". Otherwise, it prints "$100".
<br>
<br>
 Project 2: The Great Question
<br>
Description: This script prompts users to answer the Great Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. It then verifies whether the provided answer is correct.
<br>
Usage: Users are asked to input their answer to the Great Question. If the answer is "forty two", "forty-two", or "42", the script responds with "Yes". Otherwise, it responds with "No".
<br>
<br>
 Project 3: File Type Identifier
<br>
Description: This script helps users identify the file type based on the provided file name and its extension.
<br>
Usage: Users input a file name, and the script determines the corresponding file type based on its extension. Supported file types include images (gif, jpeg, png), PDFs, text files, and zip archives.
<br>
<br>
 Project 4: Expression Interpreter
<br>
Description: This script evaluates arithmetic expressions provided by users and prints the result.
<br>
Usage: Users input arithmetic expressions in the format: "number1 operator number2". The script then evaluates the expression and prints the result. Supported operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
<br>
<br>
 Project 5: Meal Time Calculator
<br>
Description: This script calculates meal times based on the current time input by the user.
<br>
Usage: Users input the current time, and the script determines whether it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner time. The script handles both 12-hour and 24-hour time formats.
<br>
<br>
Each project serves as a hands-on exercise to reinforce programming fundamentals and problem-solving skills introduced during Week 1 of CS50.
